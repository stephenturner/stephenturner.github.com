### Hi, I'm Stephen.

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square ai-3x"></i>

I'm a data scientist and senior informatics science & technology adviser at [Signature Science, LLC.](http://www.signaturescience.com/) in Charlottesville, Virginia, specializing in genomics and bioinformatics in forensics applications. I'm also a visiting faculty member in the Public Health Sciences department and in the Center for Public Health Genomics at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. While at UVA I founded the Bioinformatics Core and served as its director from 2011-2019. 

After early my early training in molecular biology, I obtained my Ph.D. in human genetics and an M.S. in statistics, and followed with a postdoc in epidemiology. I provide bioinformatics consulting, study design, and data analysis expertise, working closely with my collaborators in the experimental design and analysis of genome-scale data, with a focus on human and microbial forensics, microbial genomic epidemiology, and metagenomics.
